Amazon4Rails
============

Amazon4Rails allows a developer to declare a mapping between an ActiveRecord model 
and a product listed on Amazon. Unlike other solutions based on Ruby/Amazon,
Amozon4Rails uses the amazon-ecs library, which supports Amazon E-Commerce Services 
REST-ful 4.0 version. This library is based loosely on the wonderfully elegant plugin
load_from_amazon (a.k.a. acts_as_amazon), and strives to support its API so that anyone 
wanting to migrate over to Amazon ECS 4.0 need only change the acts_as declaration in their 
model from acts_as_amazon to the somewhat cryptic acts_as_amazonable.  Like load_from_amazon,
this plugin allows you to add functionality so that models can be created from a search 
(by ASIN) through the amazon e-commerce services and provides directives to describe how 
database fields map to the data.

== Example

class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_amazonable
  maps_to_amazon_attribute :authorlist => 'authors', :combine => ';'
  maps_to_amazon_attribute :title => 'product_name'
  maps_to_amazon_attribute :isbn => 'asin'
  maps_to_amazon_attribute :publisher => 'manufacturer'
  maps_to_amazon_attribute :pubdate => 'release_date'
end

@book = Book.load_from_amazon(isbn.to_s) # Loads but does not save
@book = Book.load_from_amazon!(isbn.to_s) # Loads data and saves to database

In addition to supporting existing loads_from_amazon features, Amazon4Rails also seeks to 
allow Amazon neo-phytes the ability to define mapping relationships based on a predefined 
set of the most popular Amazon tags. A complete list follows at the end of this file.

One of the major changes in Amazon 4.0 is the concept of Response Groups.  Response Groups 
allow you to determine the amount and type of information you receive back from Amazon for 
a given query.  Response Groups may be combined for added effect.

Rails4Amazon supports Amazon Response Groups through a simple symbol parameter.  This allows 
for complete control over the entire Amazon data feed experience.

More changes are on the way, (hopefully) including support for Amazon's remote carts.  Stay tuned!

== Installing

Amazon4Rails can be installed through the normal rails plugin system.
