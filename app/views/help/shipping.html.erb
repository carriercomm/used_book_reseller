<p>As a seller, you are free to choose any shipping provider for your products on a case-by-case basis. USPS <%= link_to "Media Mail rates", "http://www.usps.com/prices/media-mail-prices.htm", :target => "_new"%> are generally lower for most media items.</p>
<p>The way it works is that a buyer purchases your product from our store, then we notify you both via email and on the site. You may go ahead and ship
  your product with confidence, knowing that we have already collected the funds for the purchase on your behalf.</p>
<p>You choose a shipping provider, and ship your product. We prefer that you use a shipping method that can provide you with a tracking number. If it is not
  cost effective for you to use a tracking-based shipping method, don't panic - you will still be able to ship your product and get paid.</p>
<p>Once you ship your product, log into the site and view your unshipped items. Click on the item you shipped, and enter the tracking information using the form on that page. That's it! You're done.</p>
<p>Once we have confirmation of your shipment, we will disburse your funds via your preferred method of receiving payments on our next scheduled disbursement processing date. Currently, that process runs weekly, but we hope to disburse daily some time in the near future.</p>
<p>If you were unable to provide a tracking number, we still request that you provide confirmation that you shipped, but you simply choose the "No Tracking Information" option.  In this case, we will notify the buyer that the item has shipped without tracking information. Your funds will be held for 7 days or until buyer acknowledges receipt of the product, whichever is sooner.</p>
